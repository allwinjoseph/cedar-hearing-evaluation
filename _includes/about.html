<p>Dr. Nancy Sickelka began Cedar Rapids Hearing Center in 1999. Dr. Melissa Heinricy joined shortly afterward by serendipitously inquiring at Cedar Rapids Hearing Center just as the practice was ready to expand. Together, we have become the familiar faces that our patients trust and look forward to seeing for all of their hearing care needs.</p>

<p>At Cedar Rapids Hearing Center we’re known for our warm, welcoming environment and knowledgeable, professional care. We understand how difficult hearing problems can be and we’ve built a practice on accurately assessing the most effective solutions for our patients. Come see why we’ve acquired such a loyal patient base, and experience the difference of expert hearing care.</p>
