<p>I can't say enough good things about the Cedar Rapids Hearing Center! Melissa has been helping me for the last five years, and she always takes the time every three months to make sure my hearing aid is operating well. And all this is free! I really appreciate her friendliness and professional demeanor. I particularly like it that she doesn't try to "sell" me new products. Before I purchased my hearing aid, I got one to try out. There was absolutely no hard sell, but after a hearing test, I knew I needed help. I had been missing conversation and needed to have the TV on full blast....something my husband didn't appreciate. After buying my hearing aid, I can see a great difference in my participation in the various groups I belong to. I frequently tell friends how great the Center is, and without reservation I recommend the staff to all who are looking for help with their hearing. I love getting free batteries too.
